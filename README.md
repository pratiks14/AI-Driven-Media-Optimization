# AI-Driven Media Optimization

In the fast-paced world of digital marketing, e-commerce businesses must constantly refine their media investments to stay ahead of the competition. A key aspect of this is understanding how different advertising channels perform across various stages of the customer journey, which allows for more effective budget allocation. Leveraging AI-driven insights into customer behavior enables businesses to make data-driven decisions, enhancing both customer acquisition and conversion rates. This ultimately leads to higher ROI on marketing spend and increased revenue.

### Challenge Overview:

The goal of this challenge is to develop a solution that accomplishes the following:

1. **Analyze Customer Journey Data**:  
   Collect and process data related to customer interactions across various channels. The data includes customer IDs, channel sources (e.g., `google-paid`, `google-organic`, `paid-meta`, `email`, `direct`), ad campaign types, timestamps, and touchpoint types (e.g., purchase, landing page visits).

2. **Analyze Ad Spend Data**:  
   Process ad spend data, which contains information such as date, channel, campaign type, budget spent, impressions, clicks, conversions, and revenue.

3. **Use Machine Learning to Identify Trends and Patterns**:  
   Utilize machine learning techniques to uncover trends and patterns in the performance of different channels during the customer journey. Identify the influence of each channel in the downstream path, determining which channels effectively initiate conversions and which drive final conversions.

4. **Optimize Budget Allocation Based on Insights**:  
   Using the analysis, create a media investment plan that reallocates budgets across channels to maximize customer acquisition and conversion rates. The objective is to optimize ad spend to drive the highest number of conversions.

### Constraints:

- Total Budget Allocation: **$200,000**
- Each paid media channel must receive at least **10%** of the total budget.
- All campaign types within each paid channel must be assigned a portion of the budget.

### Deliverables:

Participants must submit the following:

1. **Working Prototype**:  
   A functional prototype demonstrating the AI-driven media investment solution. It should ingest, analyze, and reallocate budgets based on customer journey data, channel influence, and conversion data. The output must include projected budgets and estimated conversions for each paid channel and campaign type for the next 30 days.

2. **Process Documentation**:  
   A detailed explanation of the solution's workings, including the methodologies and algorithms used for analysis and budget allocation. This should cover data ingestion, preprocessing, machine learning models, and the budget reallocation logic.

3. **Tech Stack Documentation**:  
   Information about the technologies, tools, libraries, and frameworks used in the development of the prototype. Additionally, include installation and setup instructions for replicating the development environment.

### Evaluation Criteria:
The submissions will be evaluated based on the following:

- Accuracy and effectiveness of the media investment plan
- Innovation in using AI and machine learning techniques
- Quality and clarity of the documentation
- Usability and functionality of the prototype
